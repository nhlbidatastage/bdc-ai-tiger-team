    "# Llama3 \"Hello World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate a simple \"Hello World\" example running on the BioData Catalyst (BDC) environment using [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), an advanced large language model. Llama 3 is a sophisticated model built by Meta and capable of natural language understanding and generation, enabling users to build sophisticated text-based applications with minimal setup. A key feature of running Llama 3 within the BDC security perimeter is that it ensures the model operates entirely within the secure environment, allowing it to access sensitive data the user is authorized to view. This also ensures that no data is leaked back to external providers like OpenAI or Meta, maintaining data privacy and compliance. This notebook will guide you through the setup and provide an example of generating text from a simple input prompt, serving as a foundational starting point for working with Llama 3 securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently this notebook works on the BDC Powered by [Terra](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/) notebook environment.  In the future we will work with Velsera to ensure it works in the BDC Powered by Seven Bridges notebook environment but it currently does not due to CUDA driver limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this demo to work properly you will need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setup your [Terra](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/) account including a billing group (you can apply for startup credits in BDC if needed).  You do not need access to any controlled access BDC data for this demo.\n",
    "* Setup a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) account and generate an [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with READ permissions (minimally).\n",
    "* Apply to access the [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) model(s).  This can take minutes to hours so make sure you do that early.\n",
    "* Startup a Jupyter environment on Terra using the settings below\n",
    "* Upload this notebook file into your running Jupyter environment and then execute each cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The host environment settings we confirmed work:\n",

    "This code is performing text generation using a pre-trained language model. First, it initializes a tokenizer using the AutoTokenizer class from the Hugging Face library, which is responsible for converting input text into a format that the model can process. The pipeline function is then called with a prompt asking what meal can be made with tomatoes, basil, and cheese. The do_sample=True argument allows for random sampling during text generation, making the output less deterministic. top_k=10 restricts the sampling to the top 10 most likely tokens at each step, and num_return_sequences=1 specifies that only one generated sequence should be returned. The eos_token_id ensures the model stops generating when it reaches the end-of-sequence token, and truncation=True limits the text to a maximum length of 400 tokens. Finally, the code prints the generated text output, labeled as the result."
